## Palindrome Permutation

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a
palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same fowards and
backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome need
not be an actual word. All non characters can and should be ignored.

### Examples:
- "foobar"  - Not a palindrome
- "tactcoa" - Palindrome ["tacocat", "atcocta", ...]
